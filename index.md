### Who are we

_Feeding Hands envisions a sustainable world that consciously strives to combat resource waste._ Feeding Hands gathers supplies such as ingredients, raw food, and ready-to-go food that are still in good condition from our local culinary and supermarket industry. Feeding Hands will then repackage and redistribute the meals to the underprivileged.

Mission

Our mission is to **reduce food waste** through the redistribution of nearly expired goods - from our local culinary and supermarket industry - to underprivileged communities.
